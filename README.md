what is django framewokr?

To install Django on your system, you'll need to have Python installed first, as Django is a Python web framework. Here are the steps to install Django:

1. Check your Python version:
   First, check if you have Python installed on your system. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and type the following command to check the installed Python version:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed. Django is compatible with Python 3.6 or later. If you have Python 2.x, consider upgrading to a compatible version of Python.

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your Django project from the system-wide Python environment. To create a virtual environment, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

   Replace "myenv" with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

3. Activate the virtual environment (if you created one):
   On Windows, activate the virtual environment using the following command:

   ```
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux, activate the virtual environment with:

   ```
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

   If you don't use a virtual environment, you can skip this step.

4. Install Django using pip:
   With your virtual environment activated, or in your system-wide Python environment, you can install Django using pip, the Python package manager. Run the following command:

   ```
   pip install Django
   ```

   This command will download and install the latest version of Django.

5. Verify the installation:
   To check if Django was installed successfully, you can run the following command:

   ```
   python -m django --version
   ```

   This should display the installed Django version.

That's it! You now have Django installed on your system. You can start creating Django projects and applications and begin your web development journey.
