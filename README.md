what is django framewokr?

To install Django on your system, you'll need to have Python installed first, as Django is a Python web framework. Here are the steps to install Django:

1. Check your Python version:
   First, check if you have Python installed on your system. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and type the following command to check the installed Python version:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed. Django is compatible with Python 3.6 or later. If you have Python 2.x, consider upgrading to a compatible version of Python.

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your Django project from the system-wide Python environment. To create a virtual environment, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

   Replace "myenv" with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

3. Activate the virtual environment (if you created one):
   On Windows, activate the virtual environment using the following command:

   ```
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux, activate the virtual environment with:

   ```
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

   If you don't use a virtual environment, you can skip this step.

4. Install Django using pip:
   With your virtual environment activated, or in your system-wide Python environment, you can install Django using pip, the Python package manager. Run the following command:

   ```
   pip install Django
   ```

   This command will download and install the latest version of Django.

5. Verify the installation:
   To check if Django was installed successfully, you can run the following command:

   ```
   python -m django --version
   ```

   This should display the installed Django version.
